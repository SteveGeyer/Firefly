# The Firefly Challenge

The Firefly Challenge is a safe and low-cost solution for autonomous
drone racing. Its goal is to have a lot of fun while creating and
testing algorithms to fly autonomously. While it is our desire to have
successful timed races, the screw-ups may in fact be more fun to
watch. Over time we hope to develop mature hardware/software systems
autonomously controlling drones.

The contest is based on Tiny Whoop drones which are safe around
humans, low cost, supply first person video (FPV) and can be commanded
autonomously. The autonomy is supplied by a ground station that takes
in the drone's FPV, processes it to determine a course of action and
then commands the drone to fly along the correct path.

This project is open source and currently under development. It is the
intent of this repo to outline one or more complete hardware solutions
along with software to race on a course. We are hoping people will
take this work and extend it. Extra credit will be for those who
submit updates to the hardware and software designs or create and
document alternatives.

This effort was inspired by the
[Lockheed Martin AlphaPilot Challenge](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/events/ai-innovation-challenge.html).
We would like to think that the Firefly Challenge is exactly like the
AlphaPilot Challenge except:

* Low-cost hardware
* Designed for use in small and inexpensive venues
* Dumb drones controlled by smart ground stations
* Drones have weight limit for safety
* No sponsorship
* No Internet glory
* Hopefully a lot more fun because you can actually compete in the
  Firefly Challenge whereas the Lockheed AlphaPilot Challenge is very
  hard, to near impossible, to compete in
